README

This was my first project in MATLAB, which takes an input frequency
and 10 input values corresponding to the emphasis or dampening of the
first 10 harmonics. The user clicks "Submit" and then the GUI displays
a graph of the sine wave with the first 5 harmonics over time, and a 
graph of the cumulative sum wave generated by adding the sine wave with
the harmonics — this is known as additive synthesis. The program then
emits a 10 second tone at that frequency and timbre, and then resets. Or,
the user can manually reset it at any time by clicking "Stop".

Note: by clicking "reset", all the timbre values default to 0, which is
      interpreted as a standard harmonic progression, where each harmonic
      has (1/n)^n times the amplitude of the fundamental tone.

Note: GUI.mlapp is how I designed the app, but for ease of access, I have
      created App.m. If you run the code in App.m, it launches the app as
      intended.

In the future, I hope to be able to improve the GUI experience, and I also
want to implement Discrete Fourier Transforms to obtain a different method
of synthesizing waves, as well as a Fourier Spectrum Graph to visualize
this. I also want to add a more intuitive method of inputting timbre, 
focused more on ranges of frequencies rather than harmonics.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience both in the realm of
waves and wave analysis, as well as MATLAB.
